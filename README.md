# durp

Durp is a tool developed to aid in the rapid development of component-based tools. It provides a parsing function that makes it easy to organize project components in a highly flexible way.

To highlight the root of a component, define the name of a file (i.e. `bean.json` or `root.json`) to use as a component root. Set your `DURP_NAME` env var to string that identifies your preferred file name and extension.
